    , question: 'How will my YouTube videos look within the platform?'
    , answer: 'YouTube videos will look exactly as they do on YouTube, but they will not pull through YouTube’s overlay and pre-rolls advertising. FTBL will monetise YouTube video content with advertising content before or after the content in the news feed, much like Facebook sponsored posts work. You should view FTBL as an additional distribution point for your current videos.'
